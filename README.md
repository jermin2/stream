#### Description:
A website that allows users to subscribe and update their to a regular magazine that will get sent to them. This application interacts and stores the user data in a database which can later be extracted to create postage labels. The end-user can login and update their details, or choose to unsubscribe at any time.

This application was written using Python, HTML, CSS, with some JavaScript using the Flask framework
It uses sqlite3 to connect to a database. This should be changed later during deployment.

There are 5 main pages to this website
#### index
Index is the first page, which shows some brief information and includes a buttom to register
There is a yellow square created using CSS and an image wrapped in a div for a background.
At small screen sizes (<600px), you should only see an image. At larger screen sizes (>1500px), the yellow square should expand to fill up the gap and the image should stop getting larger. In between, the yellow squre should take up 40% of the width.

The image is contained in a div. This allows the image scale while also being cropped (by the div)
